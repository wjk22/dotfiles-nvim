# dotfiles-nvim

Hehe, neovim is IMHO the best editor out there but setting it up can be 
time consuming ..  and I like to use both nvim and vscode ..

btw it is good to copy other peoples configs, but with a brain,
if you do not understand something remove it until you know how to use it.

Linux

1. Install neovim https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim
   I use the latest stable release, download the deb package and install 
   it with dpkg -i, version 0.7 was just released.
