# dotfiles-nvim

Hehe, neovim is IMHO the best editor out there but setting it up can be 
time consuming ..  and I like to use both nvim and vscode ..

Linux

1. Install neovim https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim
   I use the latest stable release, download the deb package and install 
   it with dpkg -i, version 0.7 was just released.


Windows

1. Install Neovim with scoop
`scoop intall Neovim`
